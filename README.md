# BrowserLeaks
================

This is just a simple javascript to test what information is our browser is giving away if Javascript is enabled.
The "Internal IP detection" portion is from https://github.com/diafygi/webrtc-ips

Here are the type of information that the script will try to get.
 - Your OS
 - your browser's UserAgent
 - your browser
 - whether cookie is enabled
 - your screen size
 - your Flash version
 - whether DNT is enabled
 - whether we are using a mobile device
 - what are the plugins that our browser used.
